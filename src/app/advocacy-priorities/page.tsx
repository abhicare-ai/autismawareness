            <p>
              Increase funding for autism research at federal agencies,
              including the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease
              Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Department of Education.

            </p>
            <p>
              Ensure that individuals with autism have access to the healthcare
              they need, irrespective of payer (Medicaid, private insurance,

            </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-xl font-bold">
              Improve outcomes for transition to adulthood across the spectrum

            </p>
            <p>
              Ensure staff across settings have appropriate training,

            </p>
