              <Paragraph>
                Thereâ€™s no single medical test to diagnose autism. Instead,
                healthcare providers rely on developmental history, behavioral
                observations, and input from parents or caregivers. Through
                screenings and assessments, professionals can determine whether
                a child shows signs consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder
                (ASD).

              <Paragraph>
                Early detection is key. Screening tools are designed to flag
                early signs in toddlers and children so that families can take
                steps toward support as soon as possible. These tools do not
                provide a diagnosis on their own, but can guide whether further
                evaluation is needed.

                A parent-completed questionnaire that looks at key behaviors
                linked to autism in young toddlers. It includes a short series

                A self-assessment tool that helps identify autistic traits in
                teenagers and adults. The AQ is not a diagnostic test but can be
                a helpful first step for individuals seeking more information.
