          Raising a child with autism can feel overwhelming at times — the
          questions, the uncertainty, the stares, the milestones that come a
          little differently. But remember: every step you take with love is
          already a step forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your journey as a parent may not look like others, but it&lsquo;s
          filled with moments of incredible strength, growth, and deep
          connection. Every smile, every word, every small victory — they
          matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s okay to feel tired. It’s okay to feel confused. You are learning
          alongside your child every single day, and that makes you brave. What
          matters most is your presence, your support, and your belief in your
          child.
        </p>

        <p>
          Autism is not a limitation — it’s a different way of seeing and
          experiencing the world. Your child is unique, not broken. They are
          capable of love, joy, learning, and expression — just in their own
          way.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a parent, your unconditional love builds a foundation for your
          child to feel safe, valued, and seen. You are their biggest supporter,
          their advocate, their comfort zone.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are not alone in this journey. There are others walking the same
          path — families, doctors, therapists, and communities who care. Don’t
          be afraid to ask for help. Support is strength.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keep going. Trust yourself. Trust your child. You are doing an
          incredible job, even if it doesn&lsquo;t always feel that way.
