                One of the most important things you can do as a parent or
                caregiver is to learn the early signs of autism and become
                familiar with the developmental milestones that your child
                should be reaching.

              <Paragraph>
                Signs of autism and early signs can vary widely from child to
                child. Some children show early signs of autism within their
                first 12 months of life. In others, autism signs may show up
                around 18-24 months of age. Some children with ASD gain new
                skills and then lose them, showing regression between 18-24
                months of age. Diagnosis by an experienced professional can be
                considered reliable by age 2.
              </Paragraph>

              <Paragraph>
                The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all
                children be screened for autism at ages 18 months and 24 months,
                in addition to regular developmental checkups at 9 months, 18
                months, and 30 months.

              <Paragraph>
                Every child with autism is unique. Early identification and
                support can make a big difference in development. If you notice
                any of these signs, talk to a pediatrician or specialist for
                guidance.
