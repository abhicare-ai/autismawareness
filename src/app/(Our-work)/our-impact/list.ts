      How Ansh Found His Voice Through Homeopathy & Therapy
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted-foreground text-sm font-bold">
      By Team Rajeev Clinic
    </p>
    <p>
      Ansh, a cheerful 11-year-old boy from Bhopal, was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at the age of 4. His parents, though shocked at first, were determined to find ways to support him. Like many others, their first steps were filled with uncertainty — unclear diagnoses, conflicting advice, and emotional upheaval.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019, Ansh’s family discovered <strong>Dr. Rajeev Kumar’s Autism Homeopathy Program</strong> through a community health camp. They enrolled immediately, combining structured ABA therapy with individualized homeopathic treatment. What followed was nothing short of a transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within six months, Ansh’s severe meltdowns reduced significantly. He began making eye contact and responding to his name — small victories that meant the world to his parents. By the second year, Ansh had begun using sign language, and eventually simple words.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He said ‘Amma’ for the first time when he was seven,” recalls his mother with tears in her eyes. “We waited years for that moment.”

        <p>
          Today, Ansh attends a special education school in Bhopal and is learning to draw and play the tabla. His teachers describe him as focused, expressive, and compassionate. He also volunteers at the clinic on Sundays — handing out crayons and smiling at younger kids who walk in afraid, just like he once was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ansh’s journey is far from over, but his progress reminds us that with timely intervention, a supportive environment, and compassionate care — every child with autism can thrive.

      Dr. Rajeev Kumar’s integrative approach to autism — blending the scientific structure of therapies with the subtle healing of homeopathy — gave Ansh’s family hope when they had none.

      Today, they advocate for early diagnosis and support, urging other families not to delay seeking help.

      When Ansh was just 2 years old, his parents noticed he wasn’t responding to his name or making eye contact. While other children his age were forming words, Ansh remained quiet, living in his own peaceful world.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a formal diagnosis of autism at the age of 3, his parents were overwhelmed. They visited multiple specialists and tried various therapies but struggled to find something that truly worked for Ansh. It wasn’t until they discovered <strong>homeopathy</strong> and individualized therapies that they began seeing small, consistent progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the age of 6, Ansh was able to communicate using picture cards. At 8, he spoke his first full sentence: “I want to go outside.” For his family, it was nothing short of a miracle.

          Small Steps, Big Wins
        </p>
        <p>
          Ansh now enjoys painting, playing with colors, and even attends a small community school where teachers tailor education to his needs. Though mostly non-verbal, his expressions and gestures speak volumes. His classmates adore him, and his teachers often say he’s the heart of the classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Homeopathy sessions from Dr. Rajeev’s clinic have helped manage Sumit sensory sensitivities, sleep issues, and anxiety. His parents say it has been life-changing.

      Today, at 10 years old, Ansh can say simple words, greet guests with a hug, and express his likes and dislikes. His favorite time of day? Watering the plants and playing with colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother says, “We’ve learned to celebrate the smallest of victories. For us, every smile from Ansh is a moment of joy.”
