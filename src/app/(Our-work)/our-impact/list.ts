            <p>
              When Trey M., 30, was first diagnosed with autism in 1995 at age
              3, his family got straight to work finding information, therapies
              and supports that could help him one day live an independent life.
              But with the Internet still in its infancy, Trey’s family had
              limited access to information that could help their son. Instead,
              they took a trial-and-error approach, testing for seizures and
              dietary issues that could be the cause of their son’s biggest
              medical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              They did not find their answer until 2021, when they received
              Trey’s genetic testing results through the Autism Speaks-supported
              <strong>MSSNG program</strong>. After seven years of waiting for
              results, they learned that Trey has Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, a
              rare genetic condition caused by variants, or changes, in the
              SHANK3 gene. Features of this condition can include developmental
              and speech delays, behavioral issues, seizures and a weakened
              ability to feel pain or sweat. It is estimated that only 1-2% of
              people with autism have Phelan-McDermid syndrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now at age 30, Trey lives in a residential program and sees his
              family every weekend. He receives Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)
              therapy, speech therapy and equine therapy, and has fallen in love
              with horseback riding and hiking. Thanks to the MSSNG program,
              Trey’s family has the knowledge they need to research
              interventions that can help Trey with his unique challenges,
              giving them greater peace of mind as they plan for his future.

                  Can you tell me about Trey and his autism journey?

                <p>
                  Trey was diagnosed with autism around 3 years old. He had some
                  delays at 18 months, but his speech developed until he was 4.5
                  years old. At that point, he lost most of his words and he’s
                  basically nonverbal now. When he was 4.5, we started doing ABA
                  therapy at home to help with potty training, eye contact and
                  speech. He did drills to match colors and shapes, and flash
                  cards to learn some simple words and basic sign language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through age 12, Trey went to public school. Then, he went to
                  Heartspring, a school in Wichita, Kan. for kids with autism
                  and other developmental disabilities. At age 14, he went to
                  Melmark New England, a special education school in Andover,
                  Mass., where he had one-on-one supervision during the day. We
                  visited him every 8 weeks until he graduated at age 22.

              Now, he is back in Oklahoma and living in a residential setting
              with three other individuals with autism. There are two support
              people in his home, and he gets ABA therapy and horseback riding
              therapy. That’s one of the things he likes to do. He doesn’t like
              television—he likes to hike, walk and ride horseback. He really
              likes people—at his old program in New England, they named him
              mayor because he shakes everyone’s hand and loves making eye
              contact. He could be the greeter at Walmart, but he would never
              let go of your hand.

                  Ever since Trey was first diagnosed, we immediately started
                  searching to learn everything we could about autism. I set up
                  a bunch of online alerts to send me daily updates about
                  autism. In the beginning, it was just a broad search—what
                  could help Trey?
                </p>
                <p>
                  We tried different interventions based on our research. We
                  learned that a lot of people with autism have been helped by
                  eating a gluten-free diet, so we tried that for six months. At
                  8 years old, we took him to a gastroenterologist for an
                  endoscopy and determined that Trey does not have celiac
                  disease, so that didn’t help him.

              Another thing we did around that age was take Trey to get a
              24-hour electroencephalogram (EEG) to see if he had seizures. Our
              doctors informed us that some people with autism have
              micro-seizures that aren’t evident but cause a lot of their
              behavioral issues and other autism characteristics. That wasn’t
              the case for Trey either.
