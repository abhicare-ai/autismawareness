          We work to ensure reliable, trusted information for every life stage
          and level of need. Last year, the
          <strong>Autism Response Team (ART)</strong>  fulfilled more than
          76,500 phone calls, emails, and chats providing personalized guidance
          and support. To date, ART has made nearly 700,000 connections to
          people in need. Over 1.9 million people accessed our free resources
          and information in FY23, including our online database,
          <strong>provider directory </strong>and critical tool kits.
          Historically, Autism Speaks has assisted more than 27 million people
          with vital support.
