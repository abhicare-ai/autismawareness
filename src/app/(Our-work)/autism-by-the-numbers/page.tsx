                Finding the information you need to make informed decisions
                about you or your familyâ€™s future can be difficult. The
                landscape of services and supports for people with autism varies
                state by state, with some states providing better access to
                services than others. Local autism laws and policies also vary
                by state.

                Knowing what support is available for people with autism in your

                is scattered in online databases and reports that can be hard to
                find and understand for the average person.
