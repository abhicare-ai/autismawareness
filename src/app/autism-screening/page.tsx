              Thereâ€™s no single medical test to diagnose autism. Instead,
              healthcare providers rely on developmental history, behavioral
              observations, and input from parents or caregivers. Through
              screenings and assessments, professionals can determine whether a
              child shows signs consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

              Early detection is key. Screening tools are designed to flag early
              signs in toddlers and children so that families can take steps
              toward support as soon as possible. These tools do not provide a
              diagnosis on their own, but can guide whether further evaluation
              is needed.

                A parent-completed questionnaire that looks at key behaviors
                linked to autism in young toddlers. It includes a short series

                autism, even in children as young as 12 months.
